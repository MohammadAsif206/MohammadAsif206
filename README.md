Being deprived from attending school in my childhood, I basically had no official STEM education background when, in 2016, I started preparing for GED.
I commited myself to achieve my dream and ambition regardless of how old I was and how shaky my basic education foundation was. 
After passing my GED test, I found myself in a position where I had no excuse for not prusuing my dream. I knew my interest were in STEM majors
and at the same time I knew it was not easy as well.<br><br>
I plucked up my courage and decided to go with Software Engineering feeling assured that with it I would be able to turn abstract (ideas) into concrete.
I did my two years college at Dallas community college and the last two years at University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) from where I graduated with honor
**cum laude** in May 2021.<br><br>
Currently, I am going through an intensive training with Revature focuessed on making me learn new technologies and at the same gain hands-on expereince with those technologies.
So far, I have been trained on how to develope the following: a RESTFull API by using technologies like Python, PostgresSQL, Flask, Postman, and AWS RDS; a fullstack application using Python, PostgresSQL, Flask, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
