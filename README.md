Being deprived of attending school in my childhood, I basically had no official STEM education background when, in 2016, I started preparing for my GED. I committed myself to achieve my dream and ambition regardless of how old I was and how shaky my basic education foundation was. After passing my GED test, I found myself in a position where I had no excuse for not pursuing my dream. I knew my interest was in STEM majors and at the same time, I knew it was not easy as well.<br>

I plucked up my courage and decided to go with Software Engineering feeling assured that with it I would be able to turn abstract (ideas) into concrete. I did my two years of college at Dallas community college and the last two years at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) from where I graduated with honor **cum laude** in May 2021.<br>

Currently, I am going through an intensive training program with Revature, a program focusing on making us learn new technologies and at the same gain hands-on experience with those technologies. So far, I have been trained on how to develop the following: a RESTFull API by using technologies like Python, PostgresSQL, Flask, Postman, and AWS RDS; a full-stack application using Python, PostgresSQL, Flask, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
